1. User Authentication
   Implemented user registration, login, and logout functionalities using Laravel's built-in authentication system. This ensures that users can securely access their tasks.
2. Task Management
   Created a Task model and corresponding controller to handle CRUD operations:
   Create: Users can add new tasks.
   Read: A list view allows users to see all tasks, with options to filter by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed) and sort by due date.
   Update: Users can edit existing tasks to update details as needed.
   Delete: Tasks can be removed from the system.
3. API Development
   Developed a RESTful API using Laravel's resource routes, enabling interaction with the task management system from external applications.
4. Frontend Design
   Utilized Bootstrap for responsive and modern UI design. The application features a clean layout with a navigation bar, a hero section, and cards to display task-related actions.
5. Blade Templating
   Employed Laravel Blade templating engine for creating dynamic views, allowing for efficient rendering of HTML content while maintaining a clean codebase.
6. Validation and Error Handling
   Implemented server-side validation to ensure data integrity during task creation and updates. User-friendly error messages are displayed for any validation failures.
